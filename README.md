## 📌 Problem Statement
Classify whether a borrower will default on a loan using financial history and credit scores.

- **Course:** Artificial Intelligence
- **Assessment:** Mid-Semester Exam (MSE)

## 📚 Introduction
Loan default prediction is essential for financial institutions to minimize risk and make smart lending decisions. This project uses a machine learning approach to build a classification model that predicts loan defaults based on a borrower’s financial and demographic data.

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Preprocessed the data:
   - Dropped irrelevant features (e.g., LoanID)
   - Label encoded categorical variables
3. Sampled 20,000 rows for efficient training.
4. Split data into training and test sets (80/20).
5. Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** with 10 estimators.
6. Evaluated the model using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - Confusion matrix (heatmap)

## 🧾 Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🧪 Output / Results
- **Accuracy:** 96.05%
- **Precision:** 90.28%
- **Recall:** 87.16%

### Confusion Matrix
